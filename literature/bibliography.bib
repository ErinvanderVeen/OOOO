		While this paper is quite old (1990), I think it is a good starting
		point for my own research.

		The paper quickly introduces Othello, after which is describes the
		techniques used by the BILL 3.0 program. Many of these techniques are
		vital to our own implementation.

		Using an minimax algorithm with AlphaBeta-pruning was my initial idea.
		In this paper, they describe what techniques would make iterative
		deepening possible.

		They introduce a concept I have never heard of before, killer tables.
		This warrants further research. See \cite{reinefeld1994enhanced,
		warnock1988search, gross2002evolving}.

		Additionally, they describe a modification to the classic Alpha-Beta
		search that they call "Zero-window search". Where the idea is to
		ignore the exact differences between two moves.

		This paper approaches a chess program in a different way. Instead of
		using the very commong alpha-beta algorithm, it attempts to employ an
		evolving method. While I do not intent to create an evolving algorithm,
		this paper still had potential as it also discusses some of the more
		traditional methods.

		However, this paper has a very strong focus on chass, and the result is
		that it might not be very applicable. Should it prove valuable, I will
		extend this summary.

		This paper looks at ways to improve iterative-deepening search.
		Something that is of particular interest is the sorting of children
		nodes based om some merit value. This increases the chance for
		alpha-beta pruning. Additionally, it reasons that most search trees are
		actually graphs, and that effort should be made to avoid re-expanding
		nodes.

		I think we should always prevent doing duplicate work by using a
		hash-table. This is better described in \cite{lee1990development}.

		After this, the paper discusses two case studies, both of which are of
		no importance to us.
